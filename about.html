	<div id="about">
		<p>
			Matrix Metrology was founded with the simple goal of providing a higher level of
			customer service, expertise, and professionalism to our clients. 
		<br><br>
			We know it can be frustrating working with a big third party services firm. 
			Larger organizations, without the flexibility to staff job sites with experienced 
			staff all the time, can't maintain a steadfast commitment to both service and their 
			bottom line. 
		<br><br>
			Matrix can. We utilize our smaller size and lower overhead to meet the complex
			needs of our clients in a flexible, dynamic, and cost-effective way. Our commitment
			to providing only qualified and experienced personnel is unwavering, and we pride
			ourselves on our record of completing projects right the first time.
		<br><br>
			Our engineers are ready and willing to take on your next challenge, regardless of
			size or scope. If you're considering bringing specialized expertise to your next
			project, call Matrix today.
